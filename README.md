# Bayesian Image Super-Resolution

This repository contains the materials for the Bayesian Image Super-Resolution project

## Project Files

- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the full implementation and results of the Bayesian Image Super-Resolution.
- `28546.jpg`: Original high-resolution image used for the project.
- `finalGP.png`: Final output image after applying the Bayesian Super-Resolution technique.
- `hr1.jpg`: Processed high-resolution image for the super-resolution process.
- `patch.jpg`: Low-resolution patch extracted from the original image.
- `sr_gp_prior.jpg`: Super-resolved image using the Gaussian process prior.
- `process.gif`: A GIF showcasing the iterative process of super-resolution.

## Result Visualizations

- `loss_hr_estimation.jpg`: Visualization of the loss function during the super-resolution process.
- `loss_reg_estimation.jpg`: Visualization of the loss function for registration parameter estimation.
- `estimated_shifts.jpg`: Estimated shifts obtained during the super-resolution process.
- `estimated_angles.jpg`: Estimated rotation angles obtained during the super-resolution process.

## Usage

To reproduce the results, run the `main.ipynb` notebook, which contains all the necessary code and explanations for each step of the Bayesian Image Super-Resolution process.
